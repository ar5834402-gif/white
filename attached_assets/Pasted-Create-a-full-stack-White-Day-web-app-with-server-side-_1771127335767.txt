Create a full-stack White Day web app with server-side persistent storage and MULTI-USER support.

CRITICAL STORAGE REQUIREMENT:
- Use SQLite database that persists between repl restarts
- Store all data on SERVER, NOT browser localStorage
- Save uploaded files (photos/videos/music) to server disk
- Database must survive repl stop/start

MULTI-USER SYSTEM:
- Support UNLIMITED users (not just one couple)
- Each user gets their own account with unique username
- Each user can only see THEIR OWN content
- User A's photos/videos/coupons are completely separate from User B's
- Simple registration system (username + password + girlfriend's name)
- Each user has their own admin panel to manage their content

DATABASE STRUCTURE:
Tables needed:
- users (id, username, password_hash, girlfriend_name, created_date)
- memories (id, user_id, date, title, description, media_type, media_path)
- coupons (id, user_id, title, description, is_redeemed)
- reasons (id, user_id, reason_text)
- media_files (id, user_id, file_type, file_path, uploaded_date)

File storage organization:
/uploads/
  /user_123/
    /photos/
    /videos/
    /music/
  /user_456/
    /photos/
    /videos/
    /music/

SECURITY:

- File uploads restricted by user session
- Girlfriend password separate from admin password

  * How to upload content
  * How to share girlfriend link
  * Example girlfriend link format

LANDING PAGE:
Create attractive home page with:
- "Create Your White Day Experience" button → Register
- "Login to Your Dashboard" button → Login
- Brief explanation of what the app does
- Beautiful White Day themed design

Example User Flow:
1. Friend visits site → Clicks "Create Account"
2. Registers: username="john_doe", password="secure123", gf_name="Sarah"
3. Logs into admin dashboard
4. Uploads 10 photos, 1 video, 1 song, adds memories/coupons/reasons
5. Sets girlfriend password: "iloveyou"
6. Gets shareable link: https://yourapp.replit.dev/view/john_doe
7. Sends link to Sarah
8. Sarah enters password "iloveyou" → sees romantic personalized experience
9. Meanwhile, another friend can register as "mike_smith" with completely separate content

Keep it clean, secure, and scalable for multiple users.
