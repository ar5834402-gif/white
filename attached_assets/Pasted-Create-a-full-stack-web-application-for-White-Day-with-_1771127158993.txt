Create a full-stack web application for White Day with the following requirements:

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:
- DO NOT use browser localStorage or sessionStorage
- All data must be stored SERVER-SIDE in a persistent database
- The database should survive repl restarts and be accessible from any browser/device
- Use SQLite or PostgreSQL for the database (whichever works best in Replit)

FEATURES TO BUILD:

1. SERVER-SIDE DATABASE STORAGE:
   - Create a database that stores:
     * User authentication (username/password for my girlfriend to login)
     * Photos/images (uploaded by me, stored as files on server with database references)
     * Memory timeline entries (date, title, description, image path)
     * Love coupons/promises (title, description, redeemed status)
     * "Why I Love You" reasons (random text entries)
     * Audio files for background music (uploaded by me)
   
2. FILE UPLOAD SYSTEM:
   - Admin panel where I can upload:
     * Photos (JPEG/PNG)
     * Music files (MP3)
   - Files should be stored in server directories (like /uploads/photos, /uploads/music)
   - Database should reference file paths, not store files directly

3. AUTHENTICATION:
   - Simple login page with password (just for my girlfriend)
   - Password should be stored securely (hashed)
   - After login, she can access the app
   - I need a separate admin login to upload content

4. BACKEND API:
   - Use Express.js (Node.js) OR Flask (Python) - whichever you prefer
   - Create RESTful API endpoints:
     * POST /api/upload-photo (for me to upload photos)
     * GET /api/memories (fetch all timeline memories)
     * POST /api/redeem-coupon/:id (mark coupon as redeemed)
     * GET /api/random-reason (get random "why I love you" text)
     * GET /api/music (get music file path for player)

5. FRONTEND FEATURES:
   - Memory Timeline (scrollable, shows photos + dates + descriptions from database)
   - Love Coupons grid (fetch from database, can be clicked to redeem)
   - "Why I Love You" button (fetches random reason from database)
   - Background music player (plays music file from server)
   - All images should load from server, not base64 in browser

6. TECH STACK:
   - Backend: Node.js + Express + SQLite (OR Python + Flask + SQLite)
   - Frontend: HTML + CSS + Vanilla JavaScript (or React if easier)
   - Database ORM: Sequelize (Node) or SQLAlchemy (Python)
   - File handling: Multer (Node) or Flask file uploads

7. FOLDER STRUCTURE:
   /server
     - database.db (SQLite file - this persists data)
     - server.js or app.py (backend code)
   /uploads
     /photos
     /music
   /public
     - index.html
     - style.css
     - script.js

IMPORTANT:
- When the repl starts, the database should already exist with all my data
- Even if I stop and restart the repl, all photos, music, and memories should still be there
- Make sure file uploads actually save to disk, not just memory
- Provide me with instructions on how to add initial data (photos, music, memories)

OUTPUT:
- Working full-stack app
- README with:
  * How to add photos/music through admin panel
  * How to set girlfriend's login password
  * Database schema explanation
